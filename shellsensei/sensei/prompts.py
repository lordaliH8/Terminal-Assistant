series of commands which install the docker. Instead you should only output the first command.
- The flow will be: 1. You execute a command or ask a question 2. You see the response 3. Repeat until the task is done

Your output must be a JSON, with no extra text or explanations around it. Your output will be directly passed to ast.literal_eval()
The JSON must have 2 keys: "question" and "command"
Only one if these keys should have a value and the other should be an empty string. (based on your decision)
